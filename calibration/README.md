# Calibration Data

This is a simple program that reads several sound files, analyzes them,
and measures the peak amplitude at the frequency which they claim to be.
This peak amplitude is compared to the amplitude they claim to be. Some
useful information will be printed afterward.

## sampletones.txt

This is the file the program is hard-coded to read from. It follows a
particular layout. 

Line 1 contains the number of sample files and the directory where the
sample files are located, separated by a single space. This directory
may be absolute or relative to the program. It must end in a slash.

All subsequent lines are the tone descriptors, one per line. A tone
descriptor is 2 numerical values separated by a space. The first number
is the frequency, and the second is the amplitude. The frequency should
be an integer, but the amplitude may be an integer or a floating point
decimal number.

Tone descriptors directly determine which files will be analyzed. Your
file name must match the pattern generated by:

```c
printf("sine%d_amplitude%d.wav", frequency, percent);
```

Where `percent` is the amplitude expressed as an integer percentage of
1.

See the included sampletones.txt for more examples.
