# sound synthesis

This subdirectory contains things that will synthesize sound. Right now
it just contains some code I've hacked together for some quick proofs of
concept to make sure I can know that the project is capable of making
sound. This will not necessarily be the final product.

## diphthongs

The following diphthongs will be generated: 

```
a  ae ai ao au  
ea e  ei eo eu  
ia ie i  io iu  
oa oe oi o  ou  
ua ue ui uo u
```
